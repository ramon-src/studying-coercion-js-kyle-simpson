# SPECIAL VALUES

## NaN ("NOT A NUMBER")

It's more a invalid number than "NOT A NUMBER"

## INFINITY

It's the value returned when we use mathematical expression like using division by zero

```js
3 / 0; // returns Infinity
-4 / 0; // returns -Infinity

typeof 3 / 0; // the typeof an expression 3/0 returns NaN
```

## NULL

Is a Keyword

## UNDEFINED (void)

Is not a keyword is an identifier, it is a variable that you can technically set a value for that, until you have the strict mode which in the ES6 protected that and not allow you to set a value into it.

You should start to runs Javascript in Strict mode because all the stuffs in there is the future of the Javascript. Many features in ES6 are using by default the strict mode.
